This project contains an a schedular simulation that simulates a scheduler with an array list, a linked list, a Binary Search Tree, and Red Black Tree. Make schedulesim compiles all files

----schedulesim---
To compile: make schedulesim
To run: ./schedulesim <cpu bound proccesses> <io bound proccesses> <number of cycles> 
Description: simulation that simulates a scheduler with an array list, a linked list, a Binary Search Tree, and Red Black Tree. Prints the results in the terminal in the order of nanosec per sched, avg cpu cpu time, avg cpu wait time, avg io cpu time, avg io wait time.
